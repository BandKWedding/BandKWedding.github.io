              <p>Blake and I met on February 7th, 2016. It was Super Bowl Sunday, and I walked to Kroger with my roommate to get some snacks before we had friends over for the game. We came in through the back door and I instantly fell in love with the cute guy working the uscan. I talked about him the whole time we shopped but was too nervous to say anything to him. 
                We went to check out and every time I tried to scan something, my machine would say ‚Äúattendant has been notified to assist you‚Äù so I kept having to ask him for help. Probably the reddest I have ever been, I was so embarrassed thinking ‚Äúhere is the cutest guy I‚Äôve ever seen and he‚Äôs going to think I‚Äôm such an idiot that I can‚Äôt even buy groceries‚Äù. He later told me he was the one doing it on his little handheld to get me to turnaround and talk to him.
                Once we started talking, we found out we were both from Lexington, went to the same high school, and had so much in common. I was WAY too nervous to ask for his number and left the store, but thankfully my roommate at the time, Cassie, was there üíì. We stood right outside the back doors and she convinced me to go back in. I went to get a Dr. Pepper, my excuse for coming back. They didn‚Äôt have any, so I bought a diet which Blake would later learn I absolutely hated lol.  We started talking again and ultimately I invited him to our Super Bowl party. 
                I put my number in his phone and spent the next hour a bundle of nerves and excitement; nervous that I had given him the wrong number the way my hands were shaking, excited that I might get to hangout with this cute guy. I later found out that he had texted his mom after I left saying ‚Äúmom, I think I found her.‚Äù He came over with a friend after work and from that night on, we were inseparable.
                We both knew from day 1 that this was it for us and it‚Äôs so cool to me that we‚Äôre living out every dream we talked about in all those early months of dating. I‚Äôm excited for our next chapter and so excited to start it off celebrating with our friends and family!</p>

              <p>On February 7th, 2016, I was working during the night of the Super Bowl. I was working the self checkout stations at the back entrance of the store. 
                Lucky me, customers and managers rarely come around back there. 
                Leaned up against a trash can bored, I watched the most beautiful girl I've ever seen walk through the door. She hadn't realized I was even there yet.
                Not to stare, I looked down at my handheld and then back at her again as she walked by to say hello. 
                As I looked back up, she stared back at me with eyes as if she felt the same way. 
                She blushed as her roommate followed her into the store and they both kept walking.
                I had to do a double take just to make sure she was real. No boyfriend in sight.
                While she disappeared into the store, I was hoping she would come back to the same place she came in to check out.<br>
                With no other customers in sight, at least I think, I caught her staring at me out of the corner of my eye as her and her roommate chose a self checkout machine.
                She quickly looked away and started checking out.
                I needed an excuse to talk to her. Using the handheld, I made the self checkout appear to call for the attendant.
                When I went over to "fix it" she looked at me embarassed. Every time she looked at me, I was at a loss of words.
                Starstruck, I just smiled and walked back to my post.
                I gathered myself and did it again.. and again.. until I could finally work up the courage to make small talk.
                The more we talked, we realized that we were both from Lexington, went to Tates Creek High School, and even knew some people in common. 
                After she managed to checkout the few things she came in for in the first place, her and her roomate left. 
                Just like that, she was gone.<br>
                I stood back at my post thinking about how much I had messed up. Then she came back in. <br>
                <br>
                She forgot a drink from the machine. She walked back to the self checkout, bought it, then came over to me. 
                She came back to tell me that she was throwing a Super Bowl party, and I should come! 
                I had to play it cool, so I told her I had plans for another party with a friend, but I would come afterwards if she was still there and maybe I could bring my friend from the party?
                I had no party to go to though.
                I asked for her number to meet up at the party later, and she actually gave me her phone number.
                Then she left again.<br>
                <br>
                With no idea on what had just happened, I went back to my post yet again. 
                I only knew one thing, and being the college bad-boy I was, I texted it to my mom.
                All I could say, was that I had found her.<br>
                <br>I had found my wife.
